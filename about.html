<h2>What is SolveSpark?</h2>
<p>
SolveSpark will be a social platform that welcomes all people (regardless of race, gender, age, nationality, religion, creed, class, privilege, etc.) to post and discuss any kind of problem or idea. Topics discussed will typically range from problems affecting a particular community up to problems of a global scale.
</p><p>
This platform will utilize intuitive analytics and will seamlessly integrate simple project management-based tools to help users define the problem, dig to its root cause, and find the best solutions. This will enable users to "crowd-solve" problems together in a methodical, comprehensive, and transparent manner.
</p><p>
SolveSpark's data analytics will undergo continuous improvement to derive meaning from user feedback and optimize problem solving guidance. Analytics will help users identify vulnerabilities, such as risks, information gaps, and flaws in reasoning such as group-think and biases. The underlying algorithms will be publicly available to foster transparency and continuous improvement. The interface will remain simple, yet customizable to reach the broadest audiences and maximize potential.
</p><p>
SolveSpark's goal is to include the entire world; the more input we gather, the better our solutions will be. Every day, people have valuable insights into problems and potential solutions. Currently, there are few ways to effectively cultivate these thoughts before they are quickly forgotten.
</p><p>
SolveSpark will capture these precious day-to-day insights and give people a voice. Cumulatively, these insights will not only spark countless revelations, but inspire a philosophy of positivity, transparency, and empowerment by showing people that together, we will solve the world's toughest challenges.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>What was the inspiration behind SolveSpark?</h2>
<p>
  In 2011, I felt an air of discontent across America. It felt as if people had expected one person to magically fix the whole world. I, too, was upset-- upset at <i>America</i>.  "We need to fix our own problems in our own communities! Why can'tt people realize this?" I puzzled, while on my nightly walk. I felt so empowered by the problem-solving techniques I was learning in my Systems classes--how could I share this?  As soon as the lightbulb lit up, I could not let go of idea--the idea that would empower the world. Humanity is ready.
</p>
</div>


<div class="row">
<h2>What are the key problems SolveSpark is trying to solve?</h2>
<p>
    SolveSpark addresses several problems:
    <ul>
<li>Incomplete approach to world problems</li>
<li>No voice for the under-privileged</li>
<li>Lack of transparency/accountability</li>
<li>Wasting precious thought capital</li>
<li> <i>Slacktivism</i> is not engagement</li>
<li>Unsound problem solving</li>
<li>Little coordination between efforts</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Chasms exist between decision-makers working to solve critical problems and those actually suffering through crises. SolveSpark gives voices to everyone, including the under-privileged, introducing transparency, accountability, and more comprehensive decision-making.
</p><p>
Most initiatives only seek input from thinkers and philanthropists. By failing to capture everyone's insights, we waste vast amounts of precious intellect.
</p><p>
  Two primary ways to support causes online exist-- donate money or click <i>share</i>. SolveSpark's alternative to <i>Slacktivism</i> is active constructive engagement.
</p><p>
Many idea sites put the cart before the horse; SolveSpark discourages skipping key steps before selecting solutions.
</p><p>
SolveSpark creates a centralized location for causes to raise awareness, encouraging causes to join forces, focus their efforts, and maximize impact.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Who is SolveSpark's primary customer?</h2>
<p>
    SolveSpark aims to reach all people and spark positive change throughout the world. Specific groups impacted by SolveSpark:
<ul>
<li>Charity and non-profit organizations will see the general public voicing their opinions on issues that overlap with the organization's missions and may see an increase in awareness, support, and new ideas.</li>
<li>Governments worldwide may need to change policy and operations to accommodate changes that are demanded.</li>
<li>Researchers may contribute valuable information to SolveSpark, or use discussions as a source of information to drive analysis.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs can capitalize on a new need once it has been identified. </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>What is your business plan?</h2>
<p>
    SolveSpark will be publicly available for anyone to browse and post to the site. SolveSpark's primary source of income will be through paid monthly and yearly subscriptions for organizations. Organizations are encouraged to establish a profile page to raise awareness on their specific causes and missions, engage users, maximize efforts, and access a customized analytics and tools dashboard.
</p><p>
SolveSpark will likely offer a tiered pricing structure based on available features. Smaller organizations may be eligible for discounts to make their subscriptions more affordable. Trial subscriptions will be available to allow organizations to find the best option before committing to a plan.
</p><p>
Providing services to organizations seeking private SolveSpark instances may create additional sources of revenue.
</p><p>
If these revenue streams prove insufficient, SolveSpark may sell ad space. The content of the ads must be highly-relevant to causes on the website, in order to improve, rather than detract from user experience.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>Who are SolveSpark's competitors?  What is SolveSpark's competetive advantage?</h2>
<p>
    I believe that with my project management background, burning desire to save the world, and unique perspective, I can build a product that is different than what is already out there.
</p><p>
SolveSpark will challenge users to think critically before arriving at a solution. Many sites promote doing great things, but SolveSpark promotes doing great things responsibly by engaging all stakeholders, defining the problem, outlining requirements, assessing risks, and comparing top solutions.
</p><p>
It excites me greatly that there are a growing number of amazing sites geared towards growing ideas (such as ThinkItUp and IdeaScale), project management services (such as BaseCamp and Pivotal), and crowdfunding sites. Although these sites can be seen as competition, I choose to see them as inspiration, and even potential partners. SolveSpark will close a gap in the problem-solving process and complement existing services. Partnering with other services would potentially create force multipliers, advancing every cause. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>How will you measure social impact?</h2>
<p>
    Social impact will be measured in a variety of ways on the SolveSpark platform. Metrics such as number of users, number of posts, number of votes, demographics reached, and number of problems solved will be gathered and analyzed in real-time.
</p><p>
Social impact in the context of daily life across the globe will be more difficult to measure, however, it is possible that solutions attributed to SolveSpark create enough positive change throughout the world to make a visible difference.
</p><p>
SolveSpark will soon help people tackle the world's toughest problems, including climate change, discrimination, poverty, war, and disease. Perhaps we will transcend the limitations of today's governments and forge a closer relationship between government and the people using SolveSpark.
</p><p>
A true utopia may not be a world where problems cease to exist, but perhaps instead, a world where everyone shows true empathy for one another and bands together to solve problems.
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>What is SolveSpark's key innovation?</h2>
<p>
   In addition to bringing solid project management practices to the problem-solving process, SolveSpark aims to be a forerunner in data analytics. Analytics will not only process and provide insight into user input and but will also utilize additional user input, such as ratings, to help verify the accuracy of the results and improve algorithms.
</p><p>
Sentiment analysis will help summarize viewpoints, pattern recognition will help detect missing pieces and flaws in logic, and ratings input by users will help rank and organize data.
</p><p>
Analytics will produce infographics that are intuitive, meaningful, and insightful. Interactive simulations will allow users to manipulate and visualize data. Statistical analysis will help decision-makers select a solution.
</p><p>
SolveSpark also seeks to preserve freedom of speech and will explore creating anonymity for users who fear retaliation or other consequences from speaking out. This must be carefully balanced to prevent fraudulent activities. Please see additional documentation for more details. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>What are the biggest challenges SolveSpark will face in the near future?</h2>
<p>
SolveSpark's biggest challenges in the near future are getting established and laying basic infrastructure. Finding a co-founder and/or CTO will be immensely helpful. The ideal co-founder would keep momentum going, increase accountability, and balance my weaknesses. The ideal CTO would help drive the development of a robust, secure, and yet flexible platform.
</p><p>
Creating a basic website would allow users to start testing it and providing valuable feedback. This would launch SolveSpark onto a path of continuous improvement.
</p><p>
Challenges also include researching and seeking advice in:
<ul>
<li>Legal matters</li>
<li>Intellectual property</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Data science</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<h2>What does success look like for SolveSpark?</h2>
<p>
   Success occurs every time a person voices their opinion, every time people work together, every time a problem is solved, and even when people discover that their solution will fail. No effort will ever go to waste; it will forever be here to teach valuable lessons.
</p><p>
SolveSpark's first milestone is attaining 10,000 users. Next, attaining 10,000 faithful users, and so on. Financially, success involves enrolling several eager organizations for subscriptions.
</p><p>
This path of continuous improvement and the challenge of always building a bigger, better platform to better serve the world is extremely exciting. The hard work is always worth it.
